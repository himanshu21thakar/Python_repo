        "Regular expressions (regex) in Python are a powerful tool for matching patterns in text. Python's `re` module provides the necessary functions to work with regular expressions. Here's a basic guide to get you started:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Importing the `re` Module\n",
        "First, you need to import the `re` module:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import re\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Basic Patterns\n",
        "- **Literal Characters**: Match exact characters.\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  pattern = r\"hello\"\n",
        "  text = \"hello world\"\n",
        "  match = re.search(pattern, text)\n",
        "  if match:\n",
        "      print(\"Match found:\", match.group())\n",
        "  else:\n",
        "      print(\"No match\")\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Special Characters**:\n",
        "  - `.` : Matches any character except a newline.\n",
        "  - `^` : Matches the start of the string.\n",
        "  - `$` : Matches the end of the string.\n",
        "  - `*` : Matches 0 or more repetitions of the preceding element.\n",
        "  - `+` : Matches 1 or more repetitions of the preceding element.\n",
        "  - `?` : Matches 0 or 1 repetition of the preceding element.\n",
        "  - `{n}` : Matches exactly n repetitions of the preceding element.\n",
        "  - `{n,}` : Matches n or more repetitions of the preceding element.\n",
        "  - `{n,m}` : Matches between n and m repetitions of the preceding element.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Character Classes\n",
        "- `[abc]` : Matches any one of the characters a, b, or c.\n",
        "- `[^abc]` : Matches any character except a, b, or c.\n",
        "- `[a-z]` : Matches any lowercase letter.\n",
        "- `[A-Z]` : Matches any uppercase letter.\n",
        "- `[0-9]` : Matches any digit.\n",
        "- `\\d` : Matches any digit (equivalent to `[0-9]`).\n",
        "- `\\D` : Matches any non-digit.\n",
        "- `\\w` : Matches any word character (equivalent to `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`).\n",
        "- `\\W` : Matches any non-word character.\n",
        "- `\\s` : Matches any whitespace character.\n",
        "- `\\S` : Matches any non-whitespace character.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Grouping and Capturing\n",
        "- `( )` : Groups patterns and captures the text matched by the pattern inside the parentheses.\n",
        "- `(?: )` : Groups patterns but does not capture the text.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Alternation\n",
        "- `|` : Matches either the pattern before or the pattern after the pipe.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. Escaping Special Characters\n",
        "- Use a backslash `\\` to escape special characters if you want to match them literally.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. Common Functions\n",
        "- **`re.search(pattern, string)`**: Searches for the pattern anywhere in the string.\n",
        "- **`re.match(pattern, string)`**: Matches the pattern only at the beginning of the string.\n",
        "- **`re.findall(pattern, string)`**: Finds all occurrences of the pattern in the string and returns them as a list.\n",
        "- **`re.finditer(pattern, string)`**: Finds all occurrences of the pattern in the string and returns them as an iterator of match objects.\n",
        "- **`re.sub(pattern, repl, string)`**: Replaces all occurrences of the pattern in the string with `repl`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example Usage\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import re\n",
        "\n",
        "# Example text\n",
        "text = \"The rain in Spain falls mainly in the plain.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# Search for a pattern\n",
        "pattern = r\"Spain\"\n",
        "match = re.search(pattern, text)\n",
        "if match:\n",
        "    print(\"Match found:\", match.group())\n",
        "else:\n",
        "    print(\"No match\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Find all occurrences of a pattern\n",
        "pattern = r\"in\"\n",
        "matches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n",
        "print(\"All matches:\", matches)\n",
        "\n",
        "# Replace a pattern\n",
        "new_text = re.sub(r\"in\", \"on\", text)\n",
        "print(\"Replaced text:\", new_text)\n",
        "\n",
        "# Using groups\n",
        "pattern = r\"(\\b\\w+)\\s(\\b\\w+)\"\n",
        "matches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n",
        "print(\"Grouped matches:\", matches)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Practice\n",
        "Try creating your own patterns and test them with different strings to get comfortable with regex in Python. Regular expressions can be complex, but with practice, you'll get the hang of it!"
